# Multi-Armed-Bandits
Constructed a 10-armed testbed as described Section 2.3 of the book Reinforcement Learning â€“ An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (2nd edition).

Compared the following three methods of action value estimation:
1. epsilon-greedy action selection
2. Optimistic initial value
3. Upper-Confidence-Bound Action selection

Varied the parameters present in each of the above three action value estimation methods and analysed its affect on the % of the times optimal action is selected and the average reward. The report contains a complete anaylsis of the comparisons and performance along with the graphs generated.
